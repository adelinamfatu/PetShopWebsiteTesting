Pet Shop Software Application Testing Project

Welcome to our software application testing project repository! This project aims to ensure the reliability, security, and performance of our software application through various testing techniques including manual testing, Selenium automation, performance testing with JMeter, and security testing with OWASP ZAP, wfuzz, sqlmap, and Wapiti.

## Introduction
In this repository, we aim to comprehensively test our software application using a combination of manual and automated testing techniques. By doing so, we ensure that our application meets the highest standards of quality, reliability, and security.

## Sites
As for what sites were used, for manual/automated testing we used real existing websites that are in production and for the security part we used one of ours, made in Shopify, since there are high risks involved with this kind of testing.

## Manual Testing
Manual testing plays a crucial role in our testing process. It involves human testers meticulously evaluating the application's functionality, usability, and user interface. We document our manual testing procedures, test cases, and results to ensure thorough coverage and effective bug reporting.

## Selenium Automation
Selenium is a powerful automation tool for testing web applications. We utilize Selenium for automating repetitive tasks, regression testing, and ensuring the functionality of our web application across different browsers and platforms. Our Selenium test suites are stored in the `Selenium` directory.

## Performance Testing with JMeter
Performance testing is essential to evaluate how well our application performs under various conditions, including high load and stress. We use Apache JMeter to conduct performance tests, measure response times, identify bottlenecks, and optimize our application's performance. Our JMeter test plans are stored in the `JMeter` directory.

## Security Testing
Ensuring the security of our application is paramount. We conduct comprehensive security testing using various tools including OWASP ZAP, WFuzz, Sqlmap, Arachni and Wapiti. These tools help us identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities such as injection flaws, cross-site scripting (XSS), and broken authentication. Our security testing scripts and reports are stored in the `WFuzz`, `OWASP ZAP`, `Wapiti` and `Arachni` directories.
